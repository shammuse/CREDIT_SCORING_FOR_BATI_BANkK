## Introduction
This report analyzes credit transaction data obtained from [source]. It aims to understand the dataset's structure and integrity while preparing it for further analysis.

## Data Overview
The dataset consists of 95,662 entries and 18 columns, containing various attributes of credit transactions.

### Key Attributes
- **TransactionId**: Unique identifier for each transaction.
- **AccountId**: Identifier for the customerâ€™s account.
- **Amount**: The monetary value associated with each transaction.
- **FraudResult**: Indicates whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0).

## Data Quality Assessment
### Missing Values
Certain columns contain missing values, including:
- AccountId: 2 missing values
- CountryCode: 2 missing values
- ProviderId: 2 missing values
- Value: 3 missing values
- TransactionStartTime: 1 missing value
- PricingStrategy: 3 missing values
- Unnamed Columns: Significant missing data

### Duplicates
Duplicates were identified and removed, ensuring data integrity.

## Summary Statistics
Summary statistics provide insight into the distribution of numerical features, such as:
- **Amount**: Mean: $6,718.07, Min: -$1,000,000.00, Max: $9,880,000.00
- **Value**: Mean: $9,900.64, Min: $2.00, Max: $9,880,000.00

## Exploratory Data Analysis
### Distribution of Numerical Features
Histograms and KDE plots reveal a right-skewed distribution for the Amount feature.

### Distribution of Categorical Features
A count plot shows that only a small percentage of transactions are fraudulent (approximately 0.2%).

### Correlation Analysis
Weak correlations among numerical features were observed, with no significant predictors of fraud identified.

## Data Cleaning Process
### Handling Missing Values
Missing numeric values were filled with the median. Rows with missing categorical values were removed.

### Removing Duplicates
Duplicates were removed, resulting in a final dataset of 54,942 entries.

### Outlier Treatment
Outliers were removed based on the 1.5 * IQR rule.

## Conclusion
The data cleaning process resulted in a refined dataset of 54,942 entries, ready for further exploration or predictive modeling.

## Future Work
Further analysis could involve:
- Predictive modeling to identify potential fraudulent transactions.
- Time-series analysis to observe trends over time.

## Installation
